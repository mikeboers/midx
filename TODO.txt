- use SQLite as a shared datastore
- `midx scan` walks a directory and adds to a given datastore
    - a leading zero indicates that there is padding, otherwise assume None
    - include/exclude patterns to avoid walking into some directories
    - include/exclude patterns to not scan certain files
    - merges all new data with all old data

- how to keep SQLite data consistent without locking it?
    - when there is new data:
        1) fetch existing data
        2) merge in new data
        3) insert newly merged data (those lacking an ID)
        4) delete those which were merged (those with an ID which are
           missing from the newly merged)

- `midx watch` via fsevents and fanotify
- `midx grep`
